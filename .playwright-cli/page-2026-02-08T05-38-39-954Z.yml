          - paragraph [ref=e35]: The cracks that time has carved, the knots that mark decades of growth, the organic curves where bark once lived — these are not flaws to be hidden. They are the signatures of nature's artistry, preserved and elevated into pieces that bridge the gap between raw nature and refined living.
          - paragraph [ref=e36]: "Our philosophy is simple: the most beautiful furniture doesn't try to improve upon nature. It simply reveals what was always there, waiting to be discovered."
