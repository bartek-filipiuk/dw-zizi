# Design Prompt: Luxury Live Edge Oak Furniture Landing Page

**Author**: Manus AI
**Date**: Feb 07, 2026

## 1. Project Overview

The objective is to create an **extremely luxurious and beautiful single-page website** to showcase and generate leads for exclusive, artisan-crafted live edge oak tables. The page must serve as a high-end digital showroom, captivating visitors with stunning visuals and compelling storytelling, ultimately leading them to make contact via phone or email for inquiries and custom orders. The final deliverable will be the complete HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for this landing page.

## 2. Target Audience

The primary audience consists of high-net-worth individuals, interior designers, architects, and discerning homeowners who appreciate bespoke, high-quality, and unique furniture. They value craftsmanship, natural materials, and artistic expression over mass-produced items. Their purchasing decisions are driven by aesthetics, quality, and the story behind the product.

## 3. Core Design Philosophy: "Functional Art"

The website's design must embody the concept of "functional art." It should feel less like a standard e-commerce page and more like a gallery exhibition. The user experience should be immersive, elegant, and emotionally resonant, mirroring the quality of the furniture itself. The aesthetic should be a sophisticated blend of **rustic charm and contemporary luxury**, as seen in the provided reference images and market research [1][2][3].

## 4. Visual Identity

The visual identity will be guided by the dramatic and artistic style of the reference product photography.

| Element | Specification | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Color Palette** | **Primary**: Warm oak tones (honey, amber, caramel).<br>**Secondary**: Deep, moody teal/blue.<br>**Accent**: Matte black/dark charcoal.<br>**Neutral**: Off-white, soft cream. | This palette, derived from the reference images, creates a dramatic, high-contrast, and luxurious atmosphere that makes the wood's natural beauty the hero. |
| **Typography** | **Headlines**: Elegant, high-contrast Serif font (e.g., Playfair Display, Garamond Premier Pro).<br>**Body Text**: Clean, readable Sans-serif font (e.g., Lato, Proxima Nova). | The combination of a classic serif for impact and a modern sans-serif for clarity creates a timeless and sophisticated typographic hierarchy, a common pattern in luxury web design [4]. |
| **Mood & Tone** | Luxurious, organic, dramatic, artistic, exclusive, and tactile. | The overall feeling should be one of awe and appreciation for natural beauty and human craftsmanship. The user should feel they are viewing a unique piece of art. |

## 5. Page Structure & Content Sections

The landing page will be a single, scrolling experience composed of the following sections. The flow is designed to tell a story, from initial visual impact to detailed exploration and final contact.

### Section 1: The Hero - "A Masterpiece in Wood"
*   **Visual**: A full-screen, cinematic hero image of the most stunning live edge table, set against a dark, moody background. The image should be of the highest quality, capturing the intricate details of the wood grain and live edge.
*   **Headline**: A powerful, concise headline in a large, elegant serif font. Example: **"Where Nature Becomes Art."**
*   **Sub-headline**: A brief, evocative tagline. Example: "Discover one-of-a-kind, handcrafted oak tables that bring the soul of the forest into your home."
*   **Call-to-Action (CTA)**: A single, subtly animated button. Example: **"Explore the Collection"** which smoothly scrolls the user down the page.

### Section 2: The Philosophy - "The Art of Imperfection"
*   **Content**: This section will introduce the philosophy behind the brand. It will be a short, compelling narrative about celebrating the natural imperfections of wood—the knots, the grain, the live edge—as marks of true beauty and uniqueness. This directly addresses the visual themes identified in the reference images.
*   **Visual**: A large, beautifully shot image of a table's unique detail, like a resin inlay or a particularly interesting knot, paired with the text.

### Section 3: The Gallery - "Our Signature Collection"
*   **Content**: A curated gallery of 3-5 of the best tables. This is not a standard product grid. Each table will have its own sub-section with multiple images.
*   **Layout**: For each table, a horizontal or parallax scrolling feature will reveal a series of images: a full shot, a detail shot of the edge, a macro shot of the grain, and a lifestyle shot in a beautifully designed room. This approach is inspired by the gallery-like presentation seen on high-end design sites [2].
*   **Text**: Each table will have a short, poetic description, not a technical specification list. It will have a name (e.g., "The River Oak," "The Forest Burl") and a brief story.

### Section 4: The Craftsmanship - "From Forest to Form"
*   **Content**: This section details the artisan process. It should convey the care, skill, and time invested in each piece. Topics to cover include sustainable sourcing of the oak, the hand-shaping process, and the meticulous application of finishes and resin.
*   **Visual**: A series of high-quality images or a short, silent video montage showing hands at work: sanding the wood, pouring the resin, polishing the surface. This builds trust and justifies the premium positioning, a key element found in the research [1][3].

### Section 5: The Invitation - "Your Vision, Realized"
*   **Content**: This is the primary lead generation section. The text should be an invitation for the user to commission a custom piece. It should emphasize collaboration and the ability to create a truly personal heirloom.
*   **Functionality**: A simple, elegant contact form with the following fields:
    *   Full Name
    *   Email Address
    *   Phone Number (Optional)
    *   A multi-line text area with the prompt: "Tell us about your vision..."
*   **Alternative Contact**: Prominently display a direct **phone number** and **email address** next to the form for users who prefer direct contact.
*   **CTA Button**: A clear and compelling button, such as **"Begin Your Commission."**

### Section 6: Footer
*   **Content**: A simple, clean footer with links to social media (Instagram, Pinterest), a privacy policy, and copyright information.

## 6. Functionality & Technical Requirements

*   **Responsive Design**: The website must be perfectly responsive and provide an exceptional experience on all devices, from large desktops to mobile phones.
*   **Performance**: The site must load quickly, despite the use of high-resolution images. Lazy loading and image optimization techniques are essential.
*   **Animations**: Animations should be subtle, smooth, and elegant. Parallax scrolling effects, gentle fade-ins on scroll, and subtle hover effects on buttons will enhance the luxury feel.
*   **Contact Form**: The contact form should have client-side validation and send the submitted data to a specified email address.
